## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **H3603 — typecheck true red fixed (dual-run adjudicated)** (OxAlpha
  `glm-5.3-flash`, 28-08-2026). `npm run typecheck` exited 2 with three tsc
  errors (2× TS2307 `Cannot find module '@theme/Heading'`, 1× TS2322 `title`
  on `@theme/Layout` Props). Root cause: only
  `@docusaurus/module-type-aliases`' reduced `@theme/*` declarations reached
  the tsc program — `theme-classic.d.ts` (which declares `@theme/Heading` and
  the full Layout `title`/`description`/`noFooter`/`wrapperClassName` Props)
  was never included. Fix: `src/types/theme-classic.d.ts` pulling
  `/// <reference types="@docusaurus/theme-classic" />` into the program;
  the parallel hand-rolled declarations from PR #18
  (`src/types/docusaurus.d.ts`) are superseded by the upstream canonical set
  (their optional-`as` Heading Props would conflict with theme-classic's
  required-`as` under declaration merging). Verified: `tsc` exit 0,
  lint_census green, vitest 26/26.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-24


### Changed

- **H2820 — CLAUDE.md truth-pass** (Grok 4.6 `grok-4.6`, 16-08-2026). What this
  repo is (Docusaurus site for Bühler's 20 Russian lessons), how to run
  (`npm start` / `build` / `typecheck`), do-not-touch (`build/`, second
  dictionary parser; keep `rstTable*` in sync with SanskritGrammar). AGENTS.md
  twin regenerated.
## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-31
